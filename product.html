            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>No doubt physical activity is an important factor in promoting and improving overall health. The kind of physical activity, the intensity of doing it, and how much of it is needed, could still be arguable. That is why fitness programs abound here and there. For some enterprising people, it has even become a lucrative business and has even put brands on it. But a lot of studies have already shown that you do not need to exert too much effort and do not have to take too much time to make a positive impact on maintaining or even improving overall health. In fact, even the simplest of physical activities that we do at home or at work can be counted to contribute to daily physical activity requirements. Everyday movements as common as sitting and standing can affect a person’s health. In other words, being sedentary poses an increased risk of developing sickness more than a person that moves around. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>One good way of practicing physical activity whether at home or at work is by walking. You may not realize it or perhaps taken it for granted but walking is one of the most common forms of exercise. What’s good about it is that it is already part of our daily physical activity unless a person is just really lazy to move around, much less to do anything. While it may be true that normal slow-paced walking just to allow us to move around and about may not be significantly quantifiable to contribute positively to state of health, brisk or “lively” walking does.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Research has shown that walking at a lively pace at least 150 minutes a week can help you think better, feel better, and sleep better. That doesn’t sound much, right? This talks about 150 accumulated minutes. That means you can do short walks several times a day that can add up to 150 minutes a week. Doing this can also reduce your risk of serious diseases like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and several types of cancer. Moreover, it can improve your blood pressure, blood sugar, and blood cholesterol levels. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Other positive effects you can get out of walking include increased energy and stamina; improved mental and emotional well-being, and reduced risk of depression. A lot of benefits have been discovered about walking and we can go on and on with it. But one other benefit or advantage of walking is that it is a form of a low-impact workout. That means it does not require the same physical demand as other mainstream workouts do. Yet, it is for this reason that others may contend that it may not be as effective. But it is. You just have to do it for a much longer time. That is why it would take a minimum of 150 minutes to get any benefit. But then again, that’s 150 minutes per week. Again, that’s not much.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>By the way, have we mentioned that walking also helps promote weight loss or at the very least, prevent weight gain. That’s a fact. Now, isn’t that interesting?
